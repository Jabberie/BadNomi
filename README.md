# BadNomi

Pops up an interface panel when you talk with Nomi. 
Checks the number of options you have to set work orders and makes a button for each one. 
Press the button to post a single work order of that type.

 

I made this as friends thought it would be better to only post 1 work order of a type each time but it was time consuming to have to click through each single one.

 

New

Can now automatically pick the next work order in your available list each time you interact with Nomi

 

/nextnomi

Slash command to start the next work order on the available list

/autonomi

Auto selects the next work order on the available list each time you interact with Nomi

Hold down the Shift key to pause.

Slash command is a toggle

 

It also gives you the use of /rl (reloadui) and /fs (framestack) commands. :)
